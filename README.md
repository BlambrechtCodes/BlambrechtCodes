- 👋 Hello World! I’m @BlambrechtCodes, but you can call me B-Dog.
- 👀 I’m a student at UWL Majoring In Computer Science and Masters of Software Engineering. I enjoy learning about AI, Machine Learning, and Sorting Algorithms!
- 🌱 I’m currently (On the side) learning about Facial Recognition (With Machine Learning Integration) and (In the Classroom) interfaces.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help people better their lives and are on modern concepts, such as AI or Image Processing.
- 📫 If you are interested, feel free to email me at blambrecht04@gmail.com. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
- 🫠 By The Way: I Might Not Be Able To Respond To Messages During Certain Seasons of the Year, as My College Schedule Is Incredibly Busy!

- Thank You For Visiting My Github Page! Code On!

Best,

@BlambrechtCodes
